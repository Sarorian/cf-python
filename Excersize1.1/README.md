# Excersize 1.1 READ ME

## What I Did

1. I installed Python 3.8.7 on my machine
2. I made a new virtual enviroment called "cf-python-base"
3. I made my "add.py" program that adds two inputs from the user
4. I set up the IPython shell by installing it with pip install ipython
5. I made a requirements.txt file with the dependencies I have in the "cf-python-base" enviroment
6. I then downloaded those dependencies into a new "cf-python-clone" enviroment using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
7. I created this repo and the Excersize 1.1 folder
8. I started my learning journal and answered the questions
