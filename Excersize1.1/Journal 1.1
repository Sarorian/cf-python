1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

    Frontend web development is all about the user interface and the user experience. Where as backend web development focuses more on how the code interacts with various API's and databases. A frontend web developer would be working on the stlye of the page using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. A backend developer would work on implementing the frontend with all the API's and code that makes it work using JavaScript, Mongoose, or SQL

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

    While Python and JavaScript are both dynamically typed, the both excell at different things. Python is very versitile, excelling in backend development, data analysis, and machine learning. On the other hand, JavaScript is best at frontend development. 

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

    I want to be able to write my own API's using python, I want to be able to feel comfortable using python and not have to look over at documentation, I want to be able to easily swap between using Python and JavaScript in my applications
