# Excersize 1.2 READ ME

## What I Did

1. I learned how to use the IPython Shell
2. I learned how to use basic promts and functions
3. I learned about how variables and data types are in python compared to JavaScript
4. I learned about scalar objects and non-scalar objects
5. I learned about different ways to store data like lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries
6. I practiced with the stuff I learned in the excersizes

Explanation: I've chosen a dictionary for recipe_1 because it allows me to associate each attribute (name, cooking time, ingredients) with a descriptive key. This makes it easy to access and modify specific attributes of the recipe.
