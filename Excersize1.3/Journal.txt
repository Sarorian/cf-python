2: Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify logical statements. There are three main logical operators in Python: and, or, and not.
  and: Returns True if both statements are true.
  or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.
  not: Returns True if the statement is false.

3: Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can be organized and reused throughout your code. Functions are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters. They are useful for encapsulating code, reusability, and modularity.
